# Arina

Arina takes friendly competitions to the next level. Wether it is a wager on events, games like FIFA or chess, or any other fun competition - friends can now use smart contracts to compete against each other for money. 

Bob and Sally are playing FIFA, they can create a competition on Arina and deposit their wager amount. The full amount will then go to the winner after both players have confirmed who won. If there is no consensus on the winner, the money remains in the smart contract and Bob and Sally can compete again to determine the winner.

Alice and Mike are also in the room, and place wagers on who they think will win. Their contributions are now added to the total prize pool, that will be split among the winning side. Once a winner has been determined, the winning side can claim their share of the prize pool.
